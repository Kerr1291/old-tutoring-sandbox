#summary Some brief info on RenderObjects

= RenderObjects =

The sandbox uses what I call RenderObjects to draw things on screen. Here is what one looks like:
{{{
struct RenderObject
{
        friend class RenderManager;
        friend class Camera;

        RenderObject(GraphicData* g);
        ~RenderObject();

        void SetColor(vec4 rgba);
        void SetColor(float r, float g, float b, float a = 1.0f);

        truth visible;
        truth solid;

        private:

        float* scale;
        mat4* rot;
        vec3* pos;
       
        vec4 color;
        GraphicData* gfx;

        std::string name;
};
}}}
I want you to specially note the public fields.
{{{
        truth visible;
        truth solid;
}}}
These may be modified directly and safely with the expected desired result. If you set visible to 0 then the object will not be draw. If you set solid to 0 then you will only see the object's wireframe.

The only functions you will be calling directly will probably be SetColor? to change the object's color since creation should be done through the RengerManager? (more on this next). The only other thing to notice is that all render objects must have pointers to scale, rotation, and position data. I will explain why and how this all works in a moment.
