{
Config file for the game.
Block Comments: curly braces and brackets
Line Comments: # and ;

This config file reads in a key followed by all values to make a key-value pair.
For example, a vector would be:
myvector = 0 0 1
or
myvector = 0,0,1
or
myvector : 0 0 1

if you want to include spaces in your values, use quotes like this
name = "space guy"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reminder: the serializer doesn't know how to load data into a vector type, so
you need to use glm's value_ptr function to give it a float pointer so it can
treat the vector as an array of floats.

example: 

if our file had this in it:

StartPosition = 1.5 2 3.5

then our code would look like this:

vec3 myvector;
INIFile configFile("config.ini");
configFile.GetValue("StartPosition", glm::value_ptr(myvector));

and then myvector would have the data from StartPosition in it.
